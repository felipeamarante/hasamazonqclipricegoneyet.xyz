# Has Amazon Q CLI Price Gone Up Yet?

A completely unnecessary yet oddly satisfying website that tracks how long Amazon Q CLI has managed to resist the irresistible corporate urge to jack up its $19/month price. Starting the clock on March 17, 2025, because we all know it's just a matter of time, folks.

## Features

- A countdown to inevitable disappointment (disguised as a time counter)
- Design so minimal it's basically saying "we didn't even try that hard because what's the point?"
- Zero frameworks because apparently we hate ourselves
- Works on mobile so you can check how much time is left before price hikes while hiding in the bathroom at work

## How It Works

This technological marvel displays the precise amount of time Amazon has heroically resisted the siren call of shareholder value extraction. The counter tracks every excruciating second since March 17, 2025. When the price inevitably skyrockets (let's be honest, it's a "when" not an "if"), we'll flip a boolean and display a message that's somehow both obvious and depressing.

## Deployment

This masterpiece of modern pessimism is deployed on GitHub Pages and accessible at [hasamazonqclipricegoneyet.xyz](https://hasamazonqclipricegoneyet.xyz). Bookmark it and check daily as you would check WebMD for symptoms of a disease you're convinced you have.

## Development

To run this project locally (because apparently you have nothing better to do):

1. Clone the repository (congratulations, you've made a copy of three whole files)
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (revolutionary, I know)

No build steps or dependencies required. We're not monsters.

## Updating When Price Changes

When Amazon Q CLI inevitably succumbs to capitalism's siren song:

1. Change `priceChanged` in `script.js` from `false` to `true` (coding skills level: can toggle a boolean)
2. Commit and push the changes to GitHub
3. Pour one out for the good old days of *checks notes* $19/month

Remember: In the grand tradition of tech products, the only constant is that good deals never last.
